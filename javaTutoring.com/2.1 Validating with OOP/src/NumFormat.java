public class NumFormat {

}

/*

    4. create switch case to give options 1. convert Num to String 2. try with new nums
    5. create another scanner obj. for 4.
    1. needs to sc.nextInt()
    2. sc. input need to be 10 ints not less not more
    3. put ints in array [10] - makes it easier to convert [0]+[1] in (+[][]) braces

    1st make it imperative
    2nd make it OOP!

    example : Consider you entered the mobile number like 9 0 1 0 4 8 6 2 7 5,
    and it will convert more likely to be (+91) 9010-486275
