projects to learn to code in JAVA and better understand OOP

This is my private space to study JAVA and get better at coding.

Java was choosen as the language to study coding, because it's general purpose, has a stable community and many ressources to study with.
It's also one of the main languages to study at the LMU - Munich, and therefore useful to know in my CS-Studies.
