projects to learn to code in JAVA and better understand OOP

This is my private space to study JAVA and get better at coding.

Projects are separated by packages including all of the small projects e.g from an online ressource.
Bigger projects with a specific tasks bigger than just a simple calculation have their own modules.

Java was choosen as the language of study, because it's general purpose, has a stable community and many ressources to study with.
It's also one of the main languages to study at the LMU - Munich, and therefore useful to know in my CS-Studies.
